If you ask me for the one thing that I use everyday, I would probably say it's a 
browser and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on this boat. For better or for worse, 
browsers have become part of our lives, we use them to read our email, to keep 
ourselves informed via the news, to chat and share our thoughts with the world, 
to do our jobs, etc... I dare say it's a tool you cannot live without (unless 
of course you have been living under a rock for the last decade or so). 

There is no doubt that browsers are in high demand, just like there is no 
doubt this demand has already been met (and then some), just take a look at the 
large number of available browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, IE, Opera, Brave, 
and the [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers) goes on and on...

All of these browsers follow the [W3C standards](https://www.w3.org), allowing 
them to understand the html code and scripting languages used by the web developers 
to create web pages. Unfortunately, the execution of the code differs from 
browser to browser
